## Common File Editors

### 1. Nano Editor
`nano` is a beginner-friendly text editor available on most Linux and macOS systems. It is easy to use for basic file editing tasks.

**Opening a File:**
- To open a file in `nano`, use the following command:
  ```bash
  nano filename.txt
  ```
- If the file does not exist, `nano` will create a new one.

**Editing the File:**
- Use the arrow keys to navigate through the file.
- Type to add or modify text.

**Saving and Exiting:**
- Press `Ctrl + O` to save the file. You will be prompted to confirm the filename.
- Press `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor.

**Shortcut Summary:**
- `Ctrl + W`: Search for text in the file.
- `Ctrl + K`: Cut the current line.
- `Ctrl + U`: Paste the cut line.

### 2. Vim Editor
`vim` is a powerful and versatile text editor often used by advanced users. It has two modes: **Insert** (for editing) and **Command** (for executing commands).

**Opening a File:**
- To open a file in `vim`, use:
  ```bash
  vim filename.txt
  ```
- If the file does not exist, `vim` will create a new one.

**Basic Commands:**
- Press `i` to enter **Insert Mode** and start editing text.
- Press `Esc` to return to **Command Mode**.

**Saving and Exiting:**
- In **Command Mode**, type `:w` to save changes.
- Type `:q` to exit. To save and exit in one step, use `:wq`.
- Use `:q!` to quit without saving changes.

**Shortcut Summary:**
- `/search-term`: Search for a term in the file.
- `dd`: Delete the current line.
- `u`: Undo the last change.
- `p`: Paste copied or deleted text.

### 3. Sed (Stream Editor)
`sed` is a command-line tool for performing text transformations on files. It is useful for automating file edits without opening an editor.

**Basic Syntax:**
- `sed 's/search/replace/' filename` replaces the first occurrence of `search` with `replace` in each line of the file.
  ```bash
  sed 's/old-text/new-text/' filename.txt
  ```

**Editing In-Place:**
- Use the `-i` option to edit files in place:
  ```bash
  sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/' filename.txt
  ```

**Example:**
- To replace all occurrences of "error" with "warning" in a log file:
  ```bash
  sed -i 's/error/warning/g' logfile.txt
  ```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Using Nano for Configuration Files
- Open a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`):
  ```bash
  nano config.yaml
  ```
- Modify the desired lines.
- Save and exit with `Ctrl + O`, `Enter`, and `Ctrl + X`.

### Example 2: Using Vim for Script Edits
- Open a shell script:
  ```bash
  vim script.sh
  ```
- Press `i` to edit the script, make your changes, and press `Esc`.
- Save and exit with `:wq`.

### Example 3: Automating Edits with Sed
- Replace "localhost" with "127.0.0.1" in a configuration file:
  ```bash
  sed -i 's/localhost/127.0.0.1/' config.cfg
  ```
- Verify the changes using:
  ```bash
  cat config.cfg
  ```
