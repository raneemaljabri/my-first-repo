# What is GitHub?

## Overview
GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store, manage, track, and control changes to their code. GitHub is built on top of Git, a distributed version control system, and adds a layer of features for collaboration, project management, and automation.

## Lesson Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand what GitHub is and its key features.
- Recognize the benefits of using GitHub for version control and collaboration.
- Learn how to create and manage repositories on GitHub.
- Explore a case study of using GitHub for collaborative development.


## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides a suite of tools for version control, collaboration, and project management. Here are some key features of GitHub:

### Version Control
GitHub uses Git for version control, allowing developers to:

- Track changes to their code over time.
- Revert to previous versions if needed.
- Collaborate with others without overwriting each other's changes.

### Repositories
A repository (or "repo") is a project's folder on GitHub. It contains all the project files and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can be public or private.

### Branches
Branches allow developers to work on different features or bug fixes independently. The main branch (usually named main or master) contains the stable, production-ready code. Feature branches are created for new features or experiments.

### Pull Requests
Pull requests (PRs) are a way to propose changes to a repository. They allow developers to:

- Review and discuss changes before merging them into the main branch.
- Request feedback or approval from team members.
- Keep a record of code reviews and discussions.

### Issues
GitHub Issues is a tracking tool that allows developers to:

- Report bugs or request features.
- Assign tasks to team members.
- Track the progress of tasks and discussions.

### Actions
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool that automates workflows. It allows developers to:

- Build, test, and deploy code automatically.
- Run custom scripts or commands in response to GitHub events.
- Integrate with other tools and services.

## Case Study / Example of Using GitHub

### Project Background
A software development team is tasked with building a new web application for a startup. The team consists of developers, designers, and a project manager. They decide to use GitHub to manage the project due to its robust features for version control, collaboration, and automation.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Repository
1. Create a New Repository:

    - The project manager creates a new repository on GitHub named startup-web-app.
    - The repository is initialized with a README file, a .gitignore file, and a basic project structure.

2. Clone the Repository:
    - Each team member clones the repository to their local machine:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/username/startup-web-app.git
        ```
### Step 2: Branching Strategy
1. Main Branch:

    - The main branch is protected and used only for stable, production-ready code.
2. Feature Branches:

    - Developers create feature branches for new features or bug fixes:
        ```
        git checkout -b feature/new-feature
        ```

3. Pull Requests:

    - Once a feature is complete, the developer creates a pull request (PR) to merge the feature branch into main.
    - The PR includes a description of the changes, and team members review the code.

### Step 3: Code Reviews and Collaboration
1. Reviewing Pull Requests:

    - Team members review the PR, leaving comments and suggestions.
    - The developer addresses the feedback and makes necessary changes.

2. Merging Pull Requests:

    - Once the PR is approved, it is merged into the main branch.
    - The feature branch is then deleted to keep the repository clean.

### Step 4: Documentation and Project Management
1. README File:

    - The README.md file is updated with project documentation, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution rules.

2. Issues and Projects:

    - The team uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests.
    - GitHub Projects is used to manage the project board, organizing tasks into columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

### Step 5: Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Monitoring:

    - The team sets up monitoring tools to track the application's performance and uptime.
    - Alerts are configured to notify the team of any issues.

2. Maintenance:

    - Regular maintenance tasks, such as dependency updates and security patches, are scheduled and tracked using GitHub Issues.


## Summary
This lesson introduced GitHub, its key features, and how it can be used for collaborative development. The case study demonstrated how a team can use GitHub to manage a software development project effectively. By leveraging GitHub's features for version control, collaboration, and automation, the team can streamline their workflow, ensure code quality, and deliver a robust web application.
